# cr-sqlite

What to figure out:
- ~~gossip format~~
- ~~sync format~~
- backup + restore
    - mostly figured out in: https://github.com/vlcn-io/cr-sqlite/issues/145
- soft deletes
- ~~filters + subscriptions~~
- schema versioning (hash of sqlite_master for each table?)
- corroctl
- ~~dynamic reload of schema~~
